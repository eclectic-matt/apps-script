## Live Leaderboards files

This code takes data from a Google Sheet and updates a Google Slides presentation with the data, allowing for a live leaderboard to be displayed with both "All time" and "This Month" best times for an activity.

To use this Google Apps Script code, save the main.gs code into your main presentation. You will also need:

- a template presentation
- a Google Sheet set up to sort and filter the leaderboard entries
- and a Google form which is linked to your Google Sheet

Examples of these files will be linked below (TO DO).
